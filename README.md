CREATION INTEGRATION HUB FLOW AND SPOKES
A spoke is a scoped application that includes Flow Designer or IntegrationHub actions or subflows. A spoke is a logical grouping of related actions, subflows, and supporting application files. Developers and Process Designers can reuse spoke logic in their own applications. IntegrationHub includes baseline spokes.

CREATION AND CONFIGURATION OF DATA STREAM ACTION
Send REST, SOAP, or JDBC requests from Flow Designer to APIs that return a stream of response data larger than 10 MB, or that return paginated results. Parse stream data into a series of complex object outputs and use the data pills in other actions in a flow.

For example, create a Data Stream action to import a large quantity of employee data from a third-party HR site. The Data Stream action sends a REST request to the third-party site and processes the response to populate records in the User [sys_user] table.
